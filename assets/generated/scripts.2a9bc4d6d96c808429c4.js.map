Adding\n * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative\n * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.\n *\n * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term\n * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead\n * to an error being thrown.\n *\n * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms. A term\n * boost will make documents matching that term score higher, e.g. `foo^5`. Edit distance is also supported\n * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.\n * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.\n *\n * Each term also supports a presence modifier. By default a term's presence in document is optional, however\n * this can be changed to either required or prohibited. For a term's presence to be required in a document the\n * term should be prefixed with a '+', e.g. `+foo bar` is a search for documents that must contain 'foo' and\n * optionally contain 'bar'. Conversely a leading '-' sets the terms presence to prohibited, i.e. it must not\n * appear in a document, e.g. `-foo bar` is a search for documents that do not contain 'foo' but may contain 'bar'.\n *\n * To escape special characters the backslash character '\\' can be used, this allows searches to include\n * characters that would normally be considered modifiers, e.g. `foo\\~2` will search for a term \"foo~2\" instead\n * of attempting to apply a boost of 2 to the search term \"foo\".\n *\n * @typedef {string} lunr.Index~QueryString\n * @example <caption>Simple single term query</caption>\n * hello\n * @example <caption>Multiple term query</caption>\n * hello world\n * @example <caption>term scoped to a field</caption>\n * title:hello\n * @example <caption>term with a boost of 10</caption>\n * hello^10\n * @example <caption>term with an edit distance of 2</caption>\n * hello~2\n * @example <caption>terms with presence modifiers</caption>\n * -foo +bar baz\n */\n\n/**\n * Performs a search against the index using lunr query syntax.\n *\n * Results will be returned sorted by their score, the most relevant results\n * will be returned first.\n *\n * For more programmatic querying use lunr.Index#query.\n *\n * @param {lunr.Index~QueryString} queryString - A string containing a lunr query.\n * @throws {lunr.QueryParseError} If the passed query string cannot be parsed.\n * @returns {lunr.Index~Result[]}\n */\nlunr.Index.prototype.search = function (queryString) {\n  return this.query(function (query) {\n    var parser = new lunr.QueryParser(queryString, query)\n    parser.parse()\n  })\n}\n\n/**\n * A query builder callback provides a query object to be used to express\n * the query to perform on the index.\n *\n * @callback lunr.Index~queryBuilder\n * @param {lunr.Query} query - The query object to build up.\n * @this lunr.Query\n */\n\n/**\n * Performs a query against the index using the yielded lunr.Query object.\n *\n * If performing programmatic queries against the index, this method is preferred\n * over lunr.Index#search so as to avoid the additional query parsing overhead.\n *\n * A query object is yielded to the supplied function which should be used to\n * express the query to be run against the index.\n *\n * Note that although this function takes a callback parameter it is _not_ an\n * asynchronous operation, the callback is just yielded a query object to be\n * customized.\n *\n * @param {lunr.Index~queryBuilder} fn - A function that is used to build the query.\n * @returns {lunr.Index~Result[]}\n */\nlunr.Index.prototype.query = function (fn) {\n  // for each query clause\n  // * process terms\n  // * expand terms from token set\n  // * find matching documents and metadata\n  // * get document vectors\n  // * score documents\n\n  var query = new lunr.Query(this.fields),\n      matchingFields = Object.create(null),\n      queryVectors = Object.create(null),\n      termFieldCache = Object.create(null),\n      requiredMatches = Object.create(null),\n      prohibitedMatches = Object.create(null)\n\n  /*\n   * To support field level boosts a query vector is created per\n   * field.
